# ðŸ«€ Heart Failure Prediction (ML Models)

ðŸ“Š Project Goal
This project aims to build machine learning models to predict heart failure risk (Alive = 0, Died = 1) using patient clinical records. This can help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients early and take preventive measures.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict **heart failure risk** using patient clinical records.  
By identifying high-risk patients early, healthcare providers can take preventive action and improve survival rates.

Dataset: [UCI Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaju-barnwal/DataSets/refs/heads/main/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv)

- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies
- `results/` â†’ Confusion matrices, ROC curves, model comparison

Dataset Overview

Total Samples: 299

Features: 12 (age, anaemia, diabetes, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, smoking, etc.)

Target Variable: DEATH_EVENT (0 = Alive, 1 = Died)

Class Balance: Imbalanced (more Alive than Died cases)

---

## ðŸ§ª Models Used
- **Logistic Regression** (baseline, interpretable model)  
- **Decision Tree Classifier** (handles non-linearity, depth=5)  
- **Random Forest Classifier** (ensemble of 100 trees, depth=7)

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.79     | 0.68      | 0.66   | 0.67     | 0.86    |
| Decision Tree         | 0.74     | 0.58      | 0.72   | 0.65     | 0.75    |
| Random Forest         | **0.83** | **0.82**  | 0.62   | 0.71     | **0.89** |

- **Random Forest** â†’ Best overall model (highest accuracy & ROC-AUC).  
- **Decision Tree** â†’ Best recall (catches more true positives).  
- **Logistic Regression** â†’ Balanced performance + interpretability.

# Analysis of Results: -
â†’ Logistic Regression performed well (ROC-AUC = 0.86), showing it captures key patterns despite being a simple linear model.
â†’ Decision Tree has a higher recall (0.72), meaning it is better at catching patients at risk of death, but at the cost of precision.
â†’ Random Forest is the best overall model with the highest accuracy (83%), precision (82%), and AUC (0.89). However, recall (0.62) indicates some true high-risk patients are still missed.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
- Confusion Matrices for all models  
- ROC Curve comparison with AUC scores

# Business/Healthcare Implications:-
Logistic Regression is interpretable â†’ doctors can see which factors influence mortality.
Random Forest provides the best balance between predictive power and generalization. It could be deployed in real-world hospital settings to flag high-risk patients.
Decision Tree is simpler but less stable; however, its higher recall could be valuable if the goal is to minimise missed deaths (catch more true positives).
